            My name is Keisuke. I&apos;m a frontend developer, coffee scientist and father of two energetic sons based
            in Pirmasens - a small town in Germany close to France. Currently planning to move to Swedenüá∏üá™
          </p>
          <p>
            Before I started to work as a developer, I was a barista for many years. I love coffee! Especially
            Ethiopian-washed processed coffee. Hmm, but Kenyan is also great‚Ä¶ Wait Burundi is... When I start to talk
            about coffee, someone has to stop me! I joy talking about coffee as much as I love drinking coffee.
          </p>
          <p>
            I loved life as a barista, however, the time of Covid arrived and the caf√© where I worked had to close for a
            while. At this time, I decided to create a{' '}
            <a
              className="!dark:text-[#e5bc6b] !text-[#c5963a]"
              href="https://buddekaffee.de"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer"
            >
              website
            </a>{' '}
            for the caf√© and started to learn HTML/CSS/JS. And it lit a fire in me! It was so fun to learn it, and I was
            surprised how the codes I write on my editor turn to the website. I felt like it was magic! After a few
            hours of learning, I researched how to become a software developer. After a year of self-learning, I got
            hired by a company in Berlin -
            <a className="ml-1 !text-[#0cc147]" href="https://octily.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
              Octily
            </a>
            , and am still working there with a lot of excitement.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Octily, we develop creative web applications that help people in the HR industry to stay productive.
            Thanks to many clients of all types and genres, we develop a diverse range of applications, from dashboard
            pages to interactive maps.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the weekend, I join a dev team of a{' '}
            <a className="!text-red" href="https://plusclass-sports-incubation.co.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
              startup company
            </a>{' '}
            in Japan and develop a matching tool that connects sports teams to sponsors. Here we try many different
            modern technologies and discuss how we can create a FAST web application.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m always very curious about exploring technologies and playing with many languages & frameworks -
            however, my most strength and favourite techs are below:
          </p>
          <ul className="my-10 flex flex-col items-center gap-4">
            <Listitem label="JavaScript/Node.js/TypeScript" />
            <Listitem label="React/Next.js" />
            <Listitem label="Solid.js" />
            <Listitem label="Express" />
            <Listitem label="Tailwind CSS" />
          </ul>
          <p>
            For two years, I have been writing lines of code every day, but I never get bored. I always would be happy
            to work on a challenging project and open to trying and learning something newüôÇ Drop me some{' '}
            <Link href="/v1/contact">message</Link> and let&apos;s talk about technology (and coffee‚òïÔ∏è)!
