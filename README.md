<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>What kind technologies are used?</h3>
<p>I use TypeScript with Next.js. Styling is written with Tailwind CSS and SCSS. It's my favourite setup!</p>

<h3>Why does the home page look like PokÃ©mon?</h3>
<p>The first game I ever played was Pokemon Ruby and it took me into the digital world. If this game had not existed, I probably wouldn't have become a programmer! Pokemon Ruby is my roots as a programmer.</p>

<h3>How long did you spend to develop this website?</h3>
<p>It took about 2 - 3 weeks, total 65 hours from design to hosting. But you know, the most hardest task was writing text about me :D </p>
<p>I'm still working on this project to add more features and making fixes.</p>
