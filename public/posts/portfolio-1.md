My first portfolio is a forum where anyone can post their own espresso recipe. Extracting espresso is easy, but it can also be very complicated, once you try to extract a perfect espresso - the so-called “God Shot”. Dose, yield, brew time and temperature, grid size, water quality, TDS % (Amount of soluble solids in a liquid), Extraction % (how much percentage you extracted from coffee), roast date, humidity and so on… Every small detail affects the taste and I wanted to create a place, where everyone can publish their own professional recipe.

### Used Techs

I used TypeScript with React to create a page and pure CSS for styling.

To store data, I used Firebase. Together with the Firebase library, it was really easy to handle data in the database.

Also, the weather condition is important for the coffee taste. Weather API fetches all the weather data you need for coffee.

### Story behind

Since this was my first project with TypeScript, I had a lot of trouble with types. Once I started to process data, I always faced to type-errors and spent a huge amount of time researching. Through creating this app, I learned more about TypeScript than just watching tutorials.

### What’s next?

I love the idea of this app and have a lot more ideas to scale up this app. For example, the log-in function, coffee flavour wheel UI and more. In the future, at some point, I definitely redevelop this project.
