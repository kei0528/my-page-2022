My last portfolio, which I made before I started my current job as a frontend developer was my previous website. It’s a simple, static single-page website. It was also my first website, and I created a mockup with Adobe XD.

I still like the design, but after using it for 1 and a half years, I decided to create a new personal website, which you are currently visiting.

### Used Techs

As always, I used TypeScript with React and SCSS. At this time, I was not very sure how to implement a contact form, so I used a form service “[Static Forms](https://www.staticforms.xyz/)”. With that, you just need to fill few HTML attributes and the message can be sent. At that time, this service was absolutely enough for me.
