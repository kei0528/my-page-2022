After creating my first Portfolio, “Espresso Recipe Forum”, I realised that my weak point is the processing data, like mapping, sorting and filtering of arrays or objects.

I went through the Free API lists and found an API where you can fetch news from different sources. I thought if I develop a news page, then I have to process a lot of data and could be a good exercise.

I started to create a page and everything went smoothly. After about a month, I finished creating a page and set up the hosting. The first deployment was done and I went to the page, but the page was just blank. I checked the console and it said there is an error by fetching new data. I read through the API documentation and came to the page where I didn’t care before - which was about pricing. There was written, that using this API for the local environment is free, but if you want this to be published, you have to pay more than 400 $. I was shocked. However, I wanted to finish this project somehow, so I stored the news data locally and used this static data instead dynamic content. The page was done but I was not happy at all. What I learned from this project is - Read the documentation to the end!

### Used Techs

Like in my first portfolio, I used TypeScript and React. I wanted to upgrade my styling knowledge and changed from vanilla CSS to SCSS. For fetching news, News Api was used.
