I worked as barista at a small coffee shop in northern Berlin. I loved brewing coffee, my boss and customers. Together with my son, we went to the café at 5 o’clock in the morning, set up machines, prepared for opening the café and had breakfast. I was absolutely happy with this life, but on the other hand, I worried about my future. I knew how tough it is to work in the food industry.

Then in 2020, corona pandemic arrived in Germany, so the café where I worked had to close for many months. My worry about the future got bigger and bigger, but my wife gave me great advice. She suggested me to start learning programming.

### Spring 2020 - First step

I had interest in programming, but I neither wrote code nor researched about programming. I asked Google “How to become a programmer”. Google answered me, there are tons of staff to learn, but every developer should have at least basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. So I started to learn it on YouTube.

After 3 weeks of watching tutorials, I build my very first website. It was just fun and couldn’t stop to learn it. At this point, I was very sure that I want to be a programmer.

### Early Summer 2020 - Becoming JavaScript Master

Because I enjoyed creating a website by using HTML and CSS, I wanted to learn more about frontend techs. So I started to learn JavaScript. I watched YouTube tutorials and subscribed Japanese micro-learning platform. After completing the whole tutorial, I felt like I’m a JavaScript Master. But once I tried to write a program without any help, I didn’t know what I should write. Through tutorials, I learned about syntax, but not about the concept of creating a program. I’ve hit the wall.

### Late Summer 2020 - First project

I wanted to refresh my brain and forget about JavaScript. I decided to create a website for the café where I’ve worked. It was very fast time to create a multipage website that will be published. I didn’t know the process of creating a website and just started to write code before thinking about design and features. I made this with simple HTML and CSS with a few lines of JavaScript code. This was hosted on GitHub Pages and is today still being used!

### October 2020 - More JavaScript

After developing the website for the café, I started to learn JavaScript again. Funnily enough, this time I had no problem writing the program myself. I created a ping pong game by using JS canvas and creating a weather app. Unfortunately, I didn’t save this file anywhere.

### November 2020 - JavaScript to next level

Writing JavaScript get much more fun than before, and I wanted to move to the next step. I learned about Webpack, ES Lint and other things to upgrade my development environment. Then it was time to decide which UI Framework I learn. In 2020, the main Framework was React, Vue and Angular. I compared documentation and watched videos that will be discussed about frameworks. For me, React seemed much more friendly than other frameworks. So I started to follow React’s official tutorial and read the documentation.

### December 2020 - React, Redux, Node.js

I played a lot with React. Made Twitter clone and Todo app. This month, I subscribed online programming course and learned about Redux and Node.js.

### January 2021 - JS -> TS

I bought a TypeScript Udemy course. It took about 3 weeks to finish the course. At the end of the course, I still couldn’t understand why everyone tells TypeScript is good, but this mind turned to the opposite ones I started to create my first portfolio app.

### February 2021 - First portfolio

I started to work on my portfolio. My idea was to create a forum where everyone can post their espresso recipe. I used TypeScript with React and Firebase to store the data. I will write in detail about this app in another post.

### March 2021 - Second portfolio

I started to create my second portfolio. It’s a news page. Again here I used TypeScript and React. To get news, I used News API, which was my biggest mistake. The documentation says that using this API for development is free, but if you want to publish you have to pay money otherwise, you can’t fetch any data. I realized it too late. In the end, I put the static news data in a local file and displayed this instead. I learned how important it is to read the documentation.

### April 2021 - Third portfolio

I started to create the final project before searching for a job as a developer. That was my previous website. Here again, I used TypeScript and React. I really enjoyed building this page and when I finished it, I was so proud of myself, how much I learned in one year.

### May 2021 - Preparing for job interview

Finally, I started to prepare for a job interview. Actually, it was the most difficult step. Already writing a cover letter and résumé made me crazy. Since English and German are not my main language, I had to fix them again and again.

### June 2021 - Getting hired

I think I took about 1 and a half months just for writing a cover letter and résumé. In the middle of June, I started to apply for a job. I didn’t go to university, and also I didn’t have any experience working in the IT industry. I applied to more than 50 companies, but received only two invites to a job interview.

The funny thing is, the company that I did my first job interview hired me. I watched job interview tutorials and prepared for tech questions, but this company did not ask me any technical-related questions. I just introduced myself, asked what they do and why their name is Octily. And the job interview was done. I asked them if I should do any tests or answer any technical questions, but they said that my portfolio shows what I can and this was enough for them.

A few weeks later, I received a contract and signed it. One month later, I took my first step as a developer.

### Summary

This learning process was absolutely not easy. I was always very worried if I can really archive my goal, but my wife supported me hugely, and my son always pushed my motivation. The owners of the coffee shop had a great understanding of me. So many people supported me during this process, and I’m sure that I couldn’t archive my goal if one of them was missed. I should always keep this in mind and brush up my skills and myself in order to give them back in the future.
